    "text": "1.2 Arbitrariness: “ateş” (fire) in Different Scripts\nIt’s important to note that some of these are representations, as the scripts weren’t always used directly for modern Turkish, but for related languages or to approximate sounds.\n\n\n\nScript\nRepresentation\n\n\n\n\nLatin\nateş\n\n\nArabic\nآتش\n\n\nCyrillic\nатеш\n\n\nRunic\n𐰍𐰪𐰡𐱁\n\n\nMongolian\nᠢᠨᠪ\n\n\nJudeo-Espanol\nאטיש\n\n\n\nKey Points:\n\nNo perfect one-to-one: It’s nearly impossible to find one Turkish word with a continuous, unbroken history in all these scripts.\nApproximations: Older scripts, especially Runic, are about representing sounds, not designed for modern Turkish.\nRelated Languages: Chagatai is related, but distinct from Turkish. Mongolic script is for Mongolian, not Turkish.\nFocus on the concept: This illustrates how similar word roots could be represented in different writing systems used across the Turkic and related language families.",
