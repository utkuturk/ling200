    "text": "Preface\nThis online resource complements the in-class discussions and activities we have in our Linguistics 200 0101 section. Think of it as a dynamic guide (not a study guide!), a record of our collaborative explorations into the fascinating world of language.\nHere, you’ll find handouts that recap key concepts, exercises that challenge your assumptions, and prompts that encourage you to think critically about how language works. It’s not a summary of what we’ve done; it is also not a sufficient set of materials for getting ready for an exam.\nThe materials here are designed to be interactive. Don’t just read passively—engage with the questions, discuss with your classmates, and even challenge the ideas presented. The more you interact with these materials, the more you’ll get out of them.\nThis website is also a space for ongoing discussion and collaboration. If you have questions, insights, or even disagreements, share them! Use the Piazza forum to engage with your classmates and me. We can continue our linguistic explorations beyond the classroom walls.\nImportant Links:\n\nELMS\nPiazza Forum\n\nI hope this online resource proves to be a valuable tool in your linguistic journey. Let’s keep exploring the fascinating world of language together!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\nThe information provided in this online resource is intended for educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for attending the in-class discussion or engaging with the course material in its entirety.

    "section": "1.2 Arbitrariness",
    "text": "1.2 Arbitrariness\n\n1.2.1 “ateş” (fire) in Different Scripts\nTurkic people were nomad for almost their entire history of existence. For this reason, they ended up using many different scripts throughout their history and lived with many different cultures.\n\n\n\nScript\nRepresentation\n\n\n\n\nLatin\nateş\n\n\nArabic\nآتش\n\n\nCyrillic\nатеш\n\n\nRunic\n𐰍𐰪𐰡𐱁\n\n\nMongolian\nᠢᠨᠪ\n\n\nJudeo-Espanol\nאטיש\n\n\nGreek\nατές\n\n\nArmenian\nաթեշ\n\n\n\nThis diversity of scripts illustrates a key principle in linguistics: the arbitrariness of the sign. The connection between a word’s form (how it’s written or sounds) and its meaning is, for the most part, arbitrary. There’s no inherent reason why the sounds /ateʃ/ should mean “fire” or map to any of to writings above. This is because language is a system of conventions, not a reflection of some inherent connection between sound and meaning.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 ghoti = fish\nThink about the word ghoti in English from George Bernard Shaw. It’s a classic example demonstrating the irregularities of English spelling and pronunciation, and how seemingly unrelated and arbitrary letter combinations can produce unexpected sounds. Let’s break it down:\n\ngh: This combination, as in the word enough, can be pronounced like the “f” in fish.\no: This vowel, as in the word women, can be pronounced like the “i” in fish.\nti: This combination, as in the word nation, can be pronounced like the “sh” in fish.\n\nPutting it all together, ghoti could theoretically be pronounced “fish.” This isn’t a real word, of course, but it perfectly illustrates the arbitrariness of the sign. There’s no logical reason why those specific letters should combine to produce those sounds. It’s simply a quirk of English spelling conventions.\n\n\n1.2.3 Name Pronunciation Challenge\nNow that we’ve seen how tricky spelling and pronunciation can be, let’s put it into practice with a fun icebreaker! We’ll work in pairs of 2. Introduce yourself to your partner. Then, each partner will explain the other’s name to me, including pronunciation, meaning (if known), and any interesting facts about it. Just like ghoti, try to find some words that you can explain to me how I can learn to produce your names.",

    "text": "1.3 From Arbitrariness to Patterns: The Past Tense\nOur job as linguists is to look beyond the surface of this arbitrariness and find the underlying patterns and rules that govern language. Just like you did with your names, we look past the different spellings and pronunciations to find the common threads that connect them. Let’s explore this with something we all use (and I sometimes mess up!) every day: the past tense in English.\nHow is the past tense pronounced in each of the following words? Try to ignore the spelling and really think about how you pronounce it in each case.\n\nwalked ______\ncrashed ______\nitched ______\nallowed ______\nmugged ______\nowned ______\nneeded ______\nwaited ______\nadded ______\n\nWhat would be the past tense of the following verbs?\n\nsmick\nfrimm\nspling\npling\nthrim\n\nNow, consider the past of these verbs that change in more unpredictable ways:\n\nsing ______\nswim ______\nsleep ______\nkeep ______\n\nHow come do you know how to pronounce these words that don’t exist and thus that you have not heard the past tense forms of before?

    "text": "1.4 Grammaticality vs. Acceptability: What Does it Mean to “Know” a Language?\nNow that we’ve explored the patterns of past tense formation, let’s delve into some deeper questions about language itself. We often talk about sentences being “grammatical” or “ungrammatical,” but what does that actually mean? And how does it relate to what we consider “acceptable” or “normal” language use?\nLet’s consider these examples and discuss their grammaticality and acceptability:\n\n\n\nSentence\nGrammatical?\nDoes everyone agree?\n\n\n\n\nI went to the store yesterday.\n\n\n\n\nYesterday I to the store went.\n\n\n\n\nMe and my friend went to the mall.\n\n\n\n\nThe nanny slept the baby.\n\n\n\n\nColorless green ideas sleep furiously.\n\n\n\n\nI ain’t going there.\n\n\n\n\nAfter lunch John was tired and so he laid down for a while.\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker A: Is Sue there? Speaker B: This is she.\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker A: Where’s Sue? Speaker B: That’s she over there.\n\n\n\n\nI’m pretty sure that Mary voted for myself.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss your answers with a neighbor or in your small group. Does everyone in your group agree? Pay close attention to where there are disagreements. Why do you think people have different intuitions about these sentences?\nExercise Give me a sentence you or someone else in your life used that might create some disagreements in the group.\nHow about following sentences? Does grammaticality mean it is acceptable? Does acceptability mean it is grammatical?\n\nThe gang by the bikes were huddled.\nJohn and Mary met in the backyard, Mike did too.\nWho did Mary sing and dance with?\nMore people have been to China than I have.\nThe cheese the rat the cat chased ate perished.",
