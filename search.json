    "text": "1.2 Arbitrariness: “ateş” (fire) in Different Scripts\nIt’s important to note that some of these are representations, as the scripts weren’t always used directly for modern Turkish, but for related languages or to approximate sounds.\nScript | Representation |\nLatin | ateş |\nArabic| آتش |\nCyrillic | атеш |\nRunic | |\nMongolian | ᠢᠨᠪ |\nKey Points:\n\nNo perfect one-to-one: It’s nearly impossible to find one Turkish word with a continuous, unbroken history in all these scripts.\nApproximations: Older scripts, especially Runic, are about representing sounds, not designed for modern Turkish.\nRelated Languages: Chagatai is related, but distinct from Turkish. Mongolic script is for Mongolian, not Turkish.\nFocus on the concept: This illustrates how similar word roots could be represented in different writing systems used across the Turkic and related language families.",
