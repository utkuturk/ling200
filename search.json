    "text": "1.2 Arbitrariness\n\n1.2.1 “ateş” (fire) in Different Scripts\nTurkic people were nomad for almost their entire history of existence. For this reason, they ended up using many different scripts throughout their history and lived with many different cultures.\n\n\n\nScript\nRepresentation\n\n\n\n\nLatin\nateş\n\n\nArabic\nآتش\n\n\nCyrillic\nатеш\n\n\nRunic\n𐰍𐰪𐰡𐱁\n\n\nMongolian\nᠢᠨᠪ\n\n\nJudeo-Espanol\nאטיש\n\n\nGreek\nατές\n\n\nArmenian\nաթեշ\n\n\n\nThis diversity of scripts illustrates a key principle in linguistics: the arbitrariness of the sign. The connection between a word’s form (how it’s written or sounds) and its meaning is, for the most part, arbitrary. There’s no inherent reason why the sounds /ateʃ/ should mean “fire” or map to any of to writings above. This is because language is a system of conventions, not a reflection of some inherent connection between sound and meaning.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 ghoti = fish\nThink about the word ghoti in English from George Bernard Shaw. It’s a classic example demonstrating the irregularities of English spelling and pronunciation, and how seemingly unrelated and arbitrary letter combinations can produce unexpected sounds. Let’s break it down:\n\ngh: This combination, as in the word enough, can be pronounced like the “f” in fish.\no: This vowel, as in the word women, can be pronounced like the “i” in fish.\nti: This combination, as in the word nation, can be pronounced like the “sh” in fish.\n\nPutting it all together, ghoti could theoretically be pronounced “fish.” This isn’t a real word, of course, but it perfectly illustrates the arbitrariness of the sign. There’s no logical reason why those specific letters should combine to produce those sounds. It’s simply a quirk of English spelling conventions.\n\n\n1.2.3 Assignment 1: Name Pronunciation Challenge\nNow that we’ve seen how tricky spelling and pronunciation can be, let’s put it into practice with a fun icebreaker! We’ll work in pairs of 2. Introduce yourself to your partner. Then, each partner will explain the other’s name to me, including pronunciation, meaning (if known), and any interesting facts about it. Just like ghoti, try to find some words that you can explain to me how I can learn to produce your names.",

    "text": "1.3 From Arbitrariness to Patterns: The Past Tense\nOur job as linguists is to look beyond the surface of this arbitrariness and find the underlying patterns and rules that govern language. Just like you did with your names, we look past the different spellings and pronunciations to find the common threads that connect them. Let’s explore this with something we all use (and I sometimes mess up!) every day: the past tense in English.\nHow is the past tense pronounced in each of the following words? Try to ignore the spelling and really think about how you pronounce it in each case.\n\nwalk++ed++ ______\ncrashed ______\nitched ______\nallowed ______\nmugged ______\nowned ______\nneeded ______\nwaited ______\nadded ______\n\nNow, let’s consider some irregular verbs that change in more unpredictable ways:\n\nsing ______\nswim ______\nsleep ______\nkeep ______\n\nAfter you’ve considered these, we’ll discuss the patterns (or lack thereof!) we find and how they help us understand the rules (and exceptions!) of English past tense formation, even when the spelling tries to trick us! We’ll also talk about why these patterns exist and what they tell us about how language changes over time.",
