# Preface {.unnumbered}

This online resource complements the in-class discussions and activities we have in our Linguistics 200 0101 section. Think of it as a dynamic guide (not a study guide!), a record of our collaborative explorations into the fascinating world of language.

Here, you'll find handouts that recap key concepts, exercises that challenge your assumptions, and prompts that encourage you to think critically about how language works. It's not a summary of what we've done; it is also not a sufficient set of materials for getting ready for an exam.

The materials here are designed to be interactive. Don't just read passivelyâ€”engage with the questions, discuss with your classmates, and even challenge the ideas presented. The more you interact with these materials, the more you'll get out of them.

This website is also a space for ongoing discussion and collaboration. If you have questions, insights, or even disagreements, share them! Use the Piazza forum to engage with your classmates and me. We can continue our linguistic explorations beyond the classroom walls.

I hope this online resource proves to be a valuable tool in your linguistic journey. Let's keep exploring the fascinating world of language together!
